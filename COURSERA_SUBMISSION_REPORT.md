```

### GPU Kernels (`kernel_utils.cu`)
```cpp
__global__ void enhanceKernel(const unsigned char* input, unsigned char* output, int width, int height)
// Parallel enhancement algorithm:
// - Each thread processes one pixel
// - Applies brightness/contrast enhancement: pixel = pixel * 1.25 + 15
// - Clamps output to valid range [0, 255]
```

### Host Utilities (`host_utils.cpp`)
```cpp
// Image I/O and memory management:
- loadImagesFromDirectory(): OpenCV-based image loading
- saveImage(): Enhanced image output
