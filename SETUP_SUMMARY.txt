üéì COURSERA CUDA ASSIGNMENT - SETUP OPTIONS
===============================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: This is for Coursera CUDA at Scale Assignment!
Since you have AMD GPU (not NVIDIA), here are your options:

üìã RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:

ü•á OPTION 1: GOOGLE COLAB (FREE NVIDIA GPU)
   ‚Ä¢ Go to: https://colab.research.google.com
   ‚Ä¢ Runtime ‚Üí Change runtime type ‚Üí GPU
   ‚Ä¢ Get free Tesla T4 GPU access
   ‚Ä¢ Pre-installed CUDA environment
   ‚Ä¢ Perfect for Coursera assignments!

ü•à OPTION 2: CLOUD GPU SERVICES
   ‚Ä¢ Amazon AWS EC2 with GPU instances
   ‚Ä¢ Google Cloud Platform GPU VMs
   ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Azure GPU instances
   ‚Ä¢ Usually free tier or student credits available

ü•â OPTION 3: LOCAL CPU VERSION (if instructor allows)
   ‚Ä¢ Install Visual Studio + OpenCV only
   ‚Ä¢ Demonstrate CUDA concepts
   ‚Ä¢ May not meet assignment requirements

‚ùå NOT VIABLE (your current hardware):
   ‚Ä¢ AMD GPU cannot run CUDA
   ‚Ä¢ NVIDIA GPU required for CUDA

===============================================
üéØ RECOMMENDED: USE GOOGLE COLAB

1. Open Google Colab (free)
2. Enable GPU runtime
3. Upload your CUDA project files
4. Compile and run with real NVIDIA GPU
5. Submit results to Coursera

See COURSERA_CUDA_GUIDE.md for detailed steps!

===============================================
‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA (for Coursera):

When working, you'll demonstrate:
- ‚úÖ Real CUDA compilation on NVIDIA GPU
- ‚úÖ GPU-accelerated medical image processing
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics and GPU utilization
- ‚úÖ Enhanced medical images as output

ÔøΩ Perfect for your Coursera CUDA assignment!
