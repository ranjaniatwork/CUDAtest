# CUDA Medical Imaging - AMD GPU Alternative Solutions

## ‚ùå Current Issue:
Your system has AMD Radeon Graphics, but CUDA requires NVIDIA GPU.

## ‚úÖ Available Solutions:

### Option 1: CPU-Based Parallel Processing
Convert the CUDA kernels to OpenMP for multi-core CPU processing:
- Uses all your CPU cores for parallel image processing
- No GPU required
- Slower than GPU but still accelerated vs single-threaded

### Option 2: OpenCL Version  
Convert to OpenCL which works with AMD GPUs:
- Uses your AMD GPU for acceleration
- Cross-platform GPU computing
- More complex setup but better performance

### Option 3: CPU-Only Version
Simple single-threaded version:
- Easy to compile and run
- No special hardware requirements
- Good for testing and learning

## üöÄ Recommended: CPU OpenMP Version

I can create a version that:
‚úÖ Works on your current hardware
‚úÖ Uses multiple CPU cores for speed
‚úÖ Requires only Visual Studio + OpenCV
‚úÖ No NVIDIA GPU needed

### Modified Build Requirements:
1. Visual Studio Community (C++ tools)
2. OpenCV (for image I/O)
3. No CUDA Toolkit needed
4. No NVIDIA drivers needed

## Would you like me to create the CPU version?
This will work immediately on your system without any GPU requirements.
