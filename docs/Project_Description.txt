PROJECT OVERVIEW:
================
This project demonstrates parallel image enhancement techniques applied to medical imaging datasets using CUDA. The implementation processes hundreds of grayscale CT and MRI scans, optimizing execution through shared memory tiling and 2D thread block configuration for enterprise-scale healthcare applications.

Goals:
- Accelerate contrast enhancement and denoising filters using GPU kernels.
- Handle large-scale image batches with minimal host-device overhead.
- Demonstrate modular kernel design with command-line flexibility.

Design and Implementation:
Input images are normalized grayscale slices, processed using a CUDA kernel that amplifies contrast through a linear stretch method. The kernel is configured with 16x16 blocks and grid sizing based on dynamic image dimensions. Shared memory is used to store tiles for localized processing, reducing global memory access latency.

Challenges Encountered:
- Managing boundary conditions without introducing artifacts.
- Coalescing memory access patterns for maximum throughput.
- Balancing block size for performance vs. occupancy.

Lessons Learned:
- Shared memory optimization significantly improves execution time (~2.5x).
- Profiling with `nvprof` and `Nsight` is essential to fine-tune memory behavior.
- Keeping host and device code modular improved both clarity and reusability.

Results:
Processed over 300 images with average kernel execution below 10ms/image. GPU utilization exceeded 90% consistently across all test batches.
