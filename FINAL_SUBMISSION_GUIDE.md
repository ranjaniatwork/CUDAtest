## 🚀 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE SUBMISSION:

### Step 1: Push to GitHub (Manual)
Since the automated push failed, you need to:
1. Go to https://github.com/ranjaniatwork/CUDAtest
2. Upload your files manually, OR
3. Configure Git authentication and push locally

### Step 2: Execute in Google Colab
1. Open: https://colab.research.google.com
2. Upload: `Coursera_CUDA_Assignment.ipynb`
3. Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU
4. Upload your source files to the notebook
5. Run all cells and capture results

### Step 3: Prepare Coursera Submission
Use these files for your Coursera submission:

#### A) Project Description (Required)
Copy from: `docs/Project_Description.txt`
```
CUDA at Scale Independent Project: Medical Image Enhancement

This project demonstrates parallel image enhancement techniques applied to 
medical imaging datasets using CUDA. The implementation processes grayscale 
CT and MRI scans, optimizing execution through shared memory tiling and 2D 
thread block configuration for enterprise-scale healthcare applications.

```

#### B) Working Git Project (Required)
Submit your GitHub repository URL:
```
https://github.com/ranjaniatwork/CUDAtest
```

#### C) Proof of Execution Artifacts (Required)
Include these files/screenshots:
- Screenshot of successful CUDA compilation in Google Colab
