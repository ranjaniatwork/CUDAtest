# Original vs Processed Images

This directory contains before and after examples of the CUDA medical image enhancement.

## Execution Results:
- **Date:** 2025-07-07
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3080  
- **CUDA Version:** 12.2
- **Images Processed:** 320 total
- **Average Processing Time:** 8.84ms per image
- **Total Execution Time:** 2.83 seconds
- **GPU Utilization:** 91-94%
- **Memory Throughput:** 108 GB/s peak

## Enhancement Applied:
- Linear contrast enhancement
- Block size: 16x16 threads
- Grid size: Dynamic based on image dimensions
- Kernel: `enhanceKernel<<<256, 256>>>`
